# HTML Elements and Tags Lab 3 - Try it Yourself

## Description 📄
In the “Try It Yourself” lab, you’ll build upon the webpage structure from the previous lab, applying your understanding of HTML in a more independent setting. You’ll add new sections using appropriate header and paragraph tags, and wrap these sections in div elements to create containers for your content. This practice will not only enhance your understanding of HTML but also prepare you for future lessons on CSS. By the end of this lab, you’ll have a more comprehensive webpage and a deeper understanding of how to structure and manipulate webpages using HTML.

## Developer Objectives 📋
1. **File Navigation:** Open the `index.html` file.
2. **Section Creation:** Create new sections, each wrapped in a `<div>` element.
3. **Header Tags Insertion:** Insert appropriate header tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) for section titles.
4. **Paragraph Tag Insertion:**  Add a `<p>` tag with the given copy under each header.
5. **Content Organization:** Organize content within each `<div>` using header and paragraph tags.

## ToDo list ✅
**Attention**: When you complete a task, put an `x` in the middle of the brackets to mark it off your ToDo list.

1. [ ] Wrap the `h1` element in a `div` element. 
2. [ ] Wrap the two pairs of `h2` and `p` elements in the starter code in a `div` element. 
3. [ ] In the section with the subheader **The Golden Spiral**, add another `p` tag, then cut and paste this copy inside of it: `The birth of Fibonacci’s Food Truck was inspired by the universal appeal of the Fibonacci sequence, which in turn inspired the founders of Fibonacci’s Food Truck to embark on a culinary adventure. They envisioned a food experience that would unite the precision of mathematics with the artistry of cooking. The idea was to create dishes that, like the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, would each be a sum of the delicious flavorsthat came before. Thus, Fibonacci’s Food Truck was born, serving up a unique blend of taste and traditionthat continues to captivate food lovers everywhere`.
4. [ ] Add another `div` element below the last section.
5. [ ] Inside that `div` element, add a subheader element (choose wisely) and another `p` element.
6. [ ] In the subheader, copy and paste this copy inside it: `The Signature Dishes`.
7. [ ] In the paragraph tag, copy and past this copy inside it: `The Number 1, The Other Number 1, and The Golden Ratio At Fibonacci’s Food Truck, the menu is a gastronomic tribute to the Fibonacci sequence. The Number 1 is a wrap filled with Buffalo chicken, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, ranch, and blue cheese. This classic dish sets the tone for the rest of the menu, much like the number 1 sets the stage in the Fibonacci sequence. The Other Number 1 is a delightful vegetarian variation of the first, featuring hummus, romaine lettuce, sun-dried tomatoes, Kalamata olives, feta cheese, and tzatziki sauce. But the star of the show is undoubtedly The Golden Ratio. These fries, drenched in cheese and topped with pastrami and other toppings, are a culinary representation of the golden ratio, a key element of the Fibonacci sequence. Each bite is a testament to the harmony that can be achieved when mathematics and gastronomy unite. At Fibonacci’s Food Truck, every dish is a delicious journey through the Fibonacci sequence. Count on Fibonnaci's for flavor!`.
